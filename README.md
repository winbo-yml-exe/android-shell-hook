# Please read README before using!

Android shell hook is a tool to get access to any Android phone's terminal during boot. This can sometimes open a root shell if your phone meets the requirements. Only supports Windows as of now.

## This tool needs to be ran during the phone's second part of bootup! Below i explain so everyone understands when.

Visually, when you start your phone, it has the bootscreen with the text Powered by Android below. But after that, it only shows the OEMs logo.

Example:

The first bootup animation on a Realme phone has the text "Realme" in white. But after that, it shows a yellow logo. That's when you should run the tool.

On modern Xiaomi phones, the second boot part has the text "Powered by Xiaomi HyperOS".
