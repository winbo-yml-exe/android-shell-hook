Android shell hook is a tool to get access to any Android phone's terminal during boot. This can sometimes open a root shell if your phone meets the requirements. Only supports Windows as of now.

### Usage guide here.

To use this tool, enable USB debugging and shut your phone down. Then execute the tool. The tool will ask you to press any key when the phone is in it's second boot process. If you don't know what that is, here are examples:

The first bootup animation on a Realme phone has the text "Realme" in white. But after that, it shows a yellow logo. That's when you should run the tool.

On modern Xiaomi phones, the second boot part has the text "Powered by Xiaomi HyperOS".
